When I'm not working on these personal projects or otherwise living life, I work full-time as a software engineer for 
a financial group. In short, I manage websites that make it easy to enroll in (and handle) investments for 
complicated retirement plans. 

I was hired fresh out of college and placed on a team which was expected to bring new methods and technologies to 
our department. This involves moving past old Websphere servers with monthly deployments and towards daily
deployments and a cloud-ready API driven mindset. Currently, the business is also trying to build up the concept
of a Product Mindset. All of these journeys my team has taken on have affected how I approach development on these
projects.

Our apps have mostly Angular UIs, like my personal projects. Unlike my personal projects, they use Java Spring APIs and 
SQL databases, which makes sense for the work we do. I'm learning to appreciate Java in a way I hadn't before. However,
I still don't love it enough to use it for any of my personal projects, something I should try at some point.

Working 40 hours per week on huge projects with stakeholders in different directions makes prioritizing and evaluating 
work a constant challenge. That challenge is teaching me how to better manage my own project priorities and how to 
make business cases for my ideas. I hope to eventually start to use these skills to freelance!
