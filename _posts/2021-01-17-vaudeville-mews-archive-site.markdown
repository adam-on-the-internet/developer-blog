I recently scarped show data for the now-closed venue the Vaudeville Mews. Today I put that data
 behind an API and create a [Vaudeville Mews Archive Site][archive] that allows users to search through the data.
 
Users can search by date or by act. 
The site also allows users to see shows that happened on the current day over past years.
In this future, I may use the "today" feature for a Twitter bot.
