I decided to experiment with React by building a better UI for [The Clue Bot Twitter][cb-twitter]. 
[The Clue Bot React UI][cb-ui] has a little less detail than the original [vanilla JavaScript UI][old-ui] I made
 but is divided into different pages, allowing users to view one mystery at a time for a much cleaner 
 experience.
 This React app is hosted on GitHub Pages, my go-to since running out of free Heroku hours. 
 
 I appreciate React and how simple it is to load data, manage state, and create components, but for now
 I still much prefer Angular since I've developed by own patterns for it. If I make another extremely small app
 anytime soon I might return to React to keep experimenting.
