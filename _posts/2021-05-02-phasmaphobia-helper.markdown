This weekend I created a small new app, [Phasmaphobia Helper][phasmaphobia]. 
This is an app that helps ghost hunters in the game Phasmaphobia, a game where you
have to use tools to detect ghosts and use the evidence you find to pick what ghost type 
you are dealing with.

There are similar tools already on the internet, but I wanted to make my own so that I could make it
the way I prefer and because it was a pretty small and interesting weekend project. 
I may add some more to it in the coming weeks, but it already achieves as much as I need it to.

Its an Angular app hosted on GitHub Pages. I did not need any backend service to run this app.
