I just finished a short project [FiftyFour Blocks][fiftyfour-blocks], a web app to use when playing block stacking
games like Jenga. This replaces an old FireBase app I started years ago but never finished. It was very straight-forward
to recreate and improve this app from the older version, and felt good to see how far I'd come since initially
working on this. 

This is on my typical tech stack, an Angular 2+ UI with a Node / Express / Mongo backend. The server is my standard
server hosted on Heroku, the webpage is hosted on GitHub Pages.

With COVID I can't really test this out now, but I look forward to trying this out and adding more content someday.
