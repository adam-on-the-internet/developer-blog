For itch.io's "My First Game Jam: Summer 2020" I created a short visual novel called [Survive Maine][survive-maine].
This was inspired by and created with a collection spooky Maine photographs called "A Place Without Bodies". I
was able to make use of some music tracks got through Humble Bundle awhile back as well. I 
had created some small games before, but nothing this polished or aspirational.

The game was created with TyranoBuilder Visual Novel Studio, a tool that allows people to create Visual Novel games
with no coding. I took advantage of the code they offer (TyranoScript, essentially a subset of JavaScript) to build a
survival horror themed visual novel where you have to make it through 24 hours of random encounters. I had a 
two-week period to make the game so I ended up simplifying many of the original intentions, but I'm happy with
where it ended up. I hope I get another chance to make a Visual Novel in the future!
