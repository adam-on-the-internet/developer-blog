Today I took a break from a few projects I was working on to start this blog. I have an aversion to systems like Wordpress and Wix (though they have their place in the world) so I decided to try something new: Jekyll. Jekyll is essentially a static blog system that works well with GitHub Pages. As most of my projects are hosted on Heroku, this was also a good excuse to add a little diversity to my hosting providers.

It took me an hour or so to get my first Jekyll blog up and running on GitHub pages, but once I had the generated site published, making it my own was easy. I may add some styling later, but as this site is meant mainly to capture my thoughts, I will probably just leave it with the default theme for the time being.
