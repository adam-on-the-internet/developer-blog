I made a minor webpage that serves as game called [Missing Word](https://adam-on-the-internet.github.io/fake-fan-adam/missing-word).

This game is based on a board game called "Blank Slate", but created more in line with "Jackbox" type gameplay, 
where the players sit around a TV and the TV plays a role as a digital card-dealer so the players can all
focus on playing. All you need to play this game is a device to display the phrases to everyone, and a setup
for everyone to write (with notebooks or whiteboards).

For now, the game just picks one of the phrases at a time for the players to use for each round. There is also a brief
rule set and a button to draw the next card.

In the future, it would be ideal to add some kind of virtual scoreboard, but that does not feel necessary so I'll
only add that later if needed. I would prefer to have a generic scoreboard app to use for many similar cases in the future.

The phrase-list for this game is very short (to the point that this game is probably not playable in a practical way). 
I'll add to it over time as I do for my bots and other games.

This web page is part of an Angular app that uses an Express app to select words.
