Years ago while I was studying abroad I created a simple WordPress blog to share stories and pictures. Over the past few days I manually converted that 
small blog to a Jekyll blog so I would have more control. The picture grids aren't optimized as well as they were
on WordPress but I prefer having the blog this way without third party ads.

The new version of the blog is available at [https://adam-on-the-internet.github.io/travel-blog/][travel-blog].
