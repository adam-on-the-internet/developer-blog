After a long hiatus from new projects, I am finally wrapping up my third (and by far, biggest) twitter bot, 
[The Quest Bot][qb-twitter]. It is a bot that 
randomly generates heroes and sends them on quests until they die. It is similar to The Clue Bot but
much more involved and with a lot more randomness. I wanted to create a bot that actual told a randomly 
generated story over time, a form of Emergent Storytelling,
and with what I learned through The Clue Bot I had the patterns to do so. 
I also created [a basic UI][qb-ui] to go along with the bot
so people can engage with it beyond Twitter.

At the start of this project I wanted it to be fairly simple, but I kept adding more and more until it is
what it is today. The random heroes each have several things that affect their journey such as stats and traits,
but they also have things that, at least for now, are just there to add flavor like race and alignment.

This bot safely falls into the "0-player game" category, a game that plays itself. This was an enjoyable first concept,
I look forward to developing other things like this in the future. 

I have more ideas to add to this, and lots of more content I intended to add, but for now it is in a good spot
to run on its own for a while.
