I have started a [Character Generator](https://adam-on-the-internet.github.io/fake-fan-adam/tunnel-goons-gallery) 
for a tabletop roleplaying game system called [Tunnel Goons](https://natetreme.itch.io/tunnelgoons).

This game system has very simple character creation, which made making this app a fun minor project.

For now, this is mainly a way for me to manage characters for games I am playing, but in the future it would be ideal 
to expand the generator for players to create their own characters and modify them over time.
It would also be ideal to have generators for similar characters for other games, perhaps in a way that 
characters could be put together from different games (perhaps with some simple universal stats).

This generator is part of an Angular app and uses Express and MongoDB to create and modify characters.
