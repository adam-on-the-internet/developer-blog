During the pandemic, local venue the Vaudeville Mews closed permanently. They have a show calendar on their
website and I wanted to archive the data before it gets taken down. I hadn't done web-scraping before but it just
took an afternoon to get setup in Python and scrape the website with BeautifulSoup (a library that simplifies
scraping). I captured the data, wrote it to a csv, and then uploaded it to a [Google Sheet Archive][archive].

I have more plans for this data but now that I have it pulled down and archived, there is no rush to complete 
the project before the website gets taken down.
