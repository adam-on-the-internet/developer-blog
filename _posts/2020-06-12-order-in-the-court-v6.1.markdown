I just released version 6.1 of [Order in the Court][order-in-the-court].

# Features
* Custom Cases Hidden: custom cases no longer show in the Case Archive
* Player Names Hidden: remove player names from the Case Records & Case Archive
* Feedback Prompt: prompt players for feedback after a case closes
* UI Cleanup: minor adjustments to the interface

The main purpose of this update was that some users had played and used what I would call 'unfortunate' player names
and created an 'unpleasant' custom issue. I realized I can't proactively control what users enter, but I can remove
custom content from displaying in public to unsuspecting users. With these changes I am doing one last mass-delete of 
cases (for real this time, I hope). 

I also wanted to encourage feedback from users who are playing without my knowledge. I've been surprised by
the amount of people playing outside of play-tests. Hopefully this trend continues (with less grotesque content).
